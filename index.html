            PregVoice is an open-source project that aims to make pregnancy tests accessible for visually impaired individuals. The app will use a smartphone’s camera to detect test results and announce them aloud, offering a simple and privacy-focused solution.
        </p>

        <h2>How PregVoice Started</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Spec! PregVoice was inspired by a personal experience after a friend lost her vision during pregnancy. I realized that millions of people, particularly those who are visually impaired, struggle to read traditional pregnancy tests. Most of these tests rely on lines or symbols that can’t be interpreted by those with limited vision. Even digital tests with the potential for audio feedback don’t offer this functionality, so I decided to change that.  
            PregVoice was born out of a desire to make pregnancy tests accessible to all.
        </p>

        <h2>What PregVoice Does</h2>
        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
            <li class="list-group-item">Detect the test result – Positive, negative, or invalid (no control line).</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Announce the result aloud – Providing accessible feedback.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Ensure privacy – No data will be stored or shared.</li>
        </ul>
