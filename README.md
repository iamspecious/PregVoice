# PregVoice - Accessible Pregnancy Test Reader

PregVoice is an open-source project aimed at making pregnancy tests accessible for people with visual impairments. The app uses your smartphone's camera to read pregnancy tests and announce the result aloud. It is designed to be simple, accessible, and privacy-focused.

## Project Overview

Many pregnancy tests use visual markers like lines or crosses to indicate the result. For individuals with visual impairments, interpreting these markers can be challenging or impossible. PregVoice aims to bridge this gap by offering a solution where users can take a photo of their pregnancy test, and the app will read the result aloud.

### **Key Features:**
- Detects the test result (positive, negative, invalid, etc.)
- Announces the result aloud for visually impaired users
- Does not store any personal data or images to protect privacy
- Aims to be a simple, open-source, and free tool for everyone
